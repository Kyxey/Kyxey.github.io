        greetings: 'Hello! 👋\nMy name is [[g;green;]Ali Azizjahan] and I’m a [[b;;]Software Developer]. I’m also known as [[g;green;]Kyxey]. Now I know this is not a fancy place to meet each other, but this is where I found love! Yes! Digging down my first personal computer as a child, when I reached the command line, I felt the infinite love of instructing a computer. And that’s where I decided to learn how to write programs.\nNow please feel free to explore around and feel a little bit of the enjoyment that I felt when I was a little kid, while trying to know me better.\nYou can start by typing “[[i;;]help]” command to get a list of the available commands, alongside with their descriptions.'
